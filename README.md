### Hey there, I'm Henry ðŸ‘‹

A Graphics Research Engineer and Computer Science graduate from the UK.

I like working with low-level graphics systems architecture, and at the intersection of graphics and art.

Also interested in Machine Learning and its usage within Visual Computing.

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning about all things graphics, and the vulkan API (take a look at my [hobby renderer](https://github.com/Skittss/sumire)!).
- â˜€ Working on various shadowing and lighting systems, from clustered deferred shadows to ray tracing and BVH acceleration.
