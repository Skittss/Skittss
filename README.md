### Hey there, I'm Henry 👋

A Graphics Research Engineer and Computer Science graduate from the UK.

I like working with low-level graphics systems, and on techniques at the intersection of graphics and art.

Also interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

- ⚡ Currently involved in research of ray tracing techniques and optimizations.
- 🌱 Developing a lightweight rendering engine alongside full-time work using vulkan (take a look [here](https://github.com/Skittss/sumire)!).
- ☀️ Working on various shadowing and lighting systems, from clustered deferred shadows to ray tracing and BVH acceleration.
